# ecommerce-system-simulator

This Ecommerce System Simulator sells numerous types of products to registered customers.
The customers can order a product of their choice and the system will help ship it to them. In addition, registered users, active orders, and 
shipped orders are all tracked by the system. 

This system allows you to order products, such as shoes, books, clothing, furniture, computers and etc. 
Products can then be shipped once ordered and can even be cancelled. I also added a feature of a Cart where each customer 
possess their own cart, where they can add products, remove items from their cart and then order all item in their cart.
